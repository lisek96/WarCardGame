# WarCardGame
[REST] [MAVEN] [MVC] [JAVA EE] [JAVA 8]

Web application that allows a person to registrate, login, play automated war card game, check rankings, stats, message other players, upload an avatar.
I am using JDBC and H2 Database for this project. Server is Tomcat 9.x because I want to have access to CDI 2.0. Frontend without any framework most probably, gonna do JS, HTML, CSS, JSP (a bit, just to simplify things).
